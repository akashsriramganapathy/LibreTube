**LibreTube Local Edition** is a specialized fork developed to transform LibreTube into a fully self-contained media player. It eliminates all reliance on external Piped instances, ensuring absolute privacy and zero data leakage. Your subscriptions, playlists, and history never leave your device.


## 🚀 Exclusive Features

This fork introduces powerful capabilities not found in the official release:

### 🎧 Advanced Audio Experience
- **Inline Video Switch**: Instantly toggle between audio-only and video modes directly within the Audio player interface by replace the thumbnail with the video player.
### 📥 Power-User Downloads
- **Massive Playlist Support**: Specifically engineered to handle downloading huge local playlists. The optimized engine ensures stability and performance even when processing libraries with hundreds of tracks.

### 🔄 Integrated Self-Update System
- **Fork-Aware Updates**: Includes a custom `UpdateManager` that tracks *this specific repository*, ensuring you receive updates for the Local Edition rather than the official mainline.
- **Smart Background Checks**: A configurable `UpdateWorker` (15m to 24h) silently checks for new releases, keeping your local version current without manual intervention.
