## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔒 Local Mode Only
- **Zero Remote Dependencies**: This fork is strictly local. It does not connect to Piped instances for account management or subscriptions.
- **Privacy First**: All your data—playlists, history, subscriptions—lives securely on your device's local database.

### 🎧 Inline Video in Audio Mode
- **Seamless Switching**: In the audio player, you can instantly toggle to video mode. The video player replaces the thumbnail inline, allowing you to watch without leaving the audio interface.

### � Auto Scheduled Backup
- **Set It & Forget It**: Integrated system to automatically back up your database to your **preferred path** on a scheduled basis. Your data is always safe and recoverable without manual effort.

### 📥 Fixed Playlist Downloads
- **Huge Playlist Support**: The download engine has been patched to fix issues with massive playlists. You can now reliably download huge libraries without crashes or incomplete transfers.

### 🔄 Integrated Self-Updates
- **Fork-Aware**: Checks *this* specific repository for updates, ensuring you stay on the Local Edition track.
- **Background Checks**: Configurable background service to keep your app up to date silently.
